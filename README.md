# Pygments CSS Themes

Forked from [Uraimo's VIM styles work](https://github.com/uraimo/pygments-vimstyles)

These CSS files are modified to work with the documentation generated by [Rocco](http://rtomayko.github.com/rocco).

As such they are all effectively forked from the original CSS created Jeremy Ashkenas for [Docco](https://github.com/jashkenas/docco).
